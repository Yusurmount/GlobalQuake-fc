This data has been scraped from https://www.seismicportal.eu/fe_regions_ws/query and cleaned up to remove overlapping polygons. It includes a src attribute and a lookup table. This will support future region curation from different sources. The lookup table is to avoid having to much data while the program is running.

There is more cleanup needed mainly to fix exact border edges where low res polygons still exist.
